					People with Down Syndrome have several characteristics that are generated by their genetic mutation, but there is a common point in all of them: an intellectual deficit. But this does not prevent the person with Down Syndrome from succeeding in his professional, academic and personal life.

				<p class="lead">
					A person with Down Syndrome is a capable human being who can work in many areas, ranging from the performing arts, or a career in the field of education to political positions.
				<p/>
				<p class="lead">
					The lack of information about the syndrome and the people affected by it is the main cause of the segregation to which these people can be subjected. Therefore, it is essential to have comprehension and understatement from society and, above all, family members about the care and duties needed by those around them.
